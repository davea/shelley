package models

// --- Model tiers -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// The catalog keeps growing, and many models are strictly obviated by a newer
// or better sibling that we also offer. Rather than drop the older models
// (people may still want them, and custom configs may pin them), we sort them
// into two tiers:
//
//   - Tier 1: the models worth surfacing prominently. Nothing we also offer
//     clearly supersedes them.
//   - Tier 2: models that are "overshadowed" by another model in the same
//     available set. Still selectable, just tucked behind a "more models"
//     affordance in the UI and omitted from the subagent tool's model enum.
//
// The shadow relationships below are hand-curated. Each pair reads
// "better shadows worse": if `better` is present in the available set, then
// `worse` is demoted to tier 2. A model that is never shadowed by an available
// model stays in tier 1.

const (
	Tier1 = 1
	Tier2 = 2
)

// shadowPair records that model `Better` overshadows model `Worse`: when both
// are available, `Worse` drops to tier 2.
type shadowPair struct {
	Better string
	Worse  string
}

// shadowPairs is the curated list of "better shadows worse" relationships.
// See the package doc above for the semantics. IDs that aren't in the catalog
// (e.g. a not-yet-launched release) are harmless: they simply never match an
// available model.
var shadowPairs = []shadowPair{
	// Clear supersessions within a family.
	{Better: "claude-opus-4.8", Worse: "claude-opus-4.7"},
	{Better: "claude-opus-4.6", Worse: "claude-opus-4.5"},

	// default list stays lean; the reasoning is noted inline.

	{Better: "glm-5.2-fireworks", Worse: "qwen3.7-plus-fireworks"}, // different families; glm costs a bit more

// AssignTiers computes the tier (Tier1 or Tier2) for each of the given model
